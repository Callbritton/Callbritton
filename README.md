### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I am a driven and capable Software Developer who thrives working in teams and in leadership roles. In my prior roles as Construction Project Manager and Safety Manager I have honed my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and servant-leadership.

Now I am focusing on applying these skills to build software solutions through well-tested, maintainable, and intuitive code. I have long dreamt of a career in software, and I am incredibly excited and committed to be learning and growing each day.

I am confident working with Ruby, Rails, SQL, HTML, and CSS. Iâ€™ve also worked with JavaScript and dabbled with Python. Though I have primarily focused on Backend Web Development, I have a keen interest in Frontend development and thoroughly enjoy the art and polish of the craft.
