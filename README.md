### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I am a driven and capable Software Developer who thrives when working in teams and in leadership roles. In my prior roles as Construction Project Manager and Safety Manager I have honed my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and servant-leadership.

Now I am focusing on applying these skills to build software solutions through well-tested, maintainable, and intuitive code.

I am confident working with Ruby, Rails, SQL, HTML, and CSS. Iâ€™ve also worked with JavaScript and dabbled with Python. Though I have primarily focused on Backend Web Development, I have a keen interest in Frontend development and thoroughly enjoy the art and polish of the craft.
